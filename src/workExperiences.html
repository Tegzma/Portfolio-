    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <h4>Developers Institute</h4>
    <p>
      After two years of being a stay at home mum, and with many people losing
      their jobs with the impact of COVID lockdowns, I found it almost
      impossible to find job opportunities. I put all my efforts into my studies
      with Developers Institute and in the end, was offered a position as an
      Associate Developer. My role is split into two parts Quality Assurance and
      Learner Wellbeing. For Quality Assurance my role would be working with
      NZQA to ensure that we provided well-rounded material that reflects the
      needs of potential employers for graduates, working through code projects
      to ensure that they are graded fairly and accurately and overall as a
      business ensuring that we learners are achieving as expected. As the
      learner wellbeing support, I would aid learners with different tools they
      could use to help them code, work through exercises, hold one on one
      sessions if they needed help going over materials and discussing their
      work-life balance. As part of the Developers Institute team, I have been
      able to work on different projects including updating our website using
      contentful, collaborating on projects to share with learners with our
      latest project to build software that supports online education to combine
      several platforms we use into one interface to collate data. We use Agile
      work methods in a high trust environment, where we collaborate using the
      shape up method to work on projects. We utilise tools such as Jira and
      Confluence to document and visualise tasks that need to be done. I have
      already grown in so many ways with Developers Institute where again I have
      started to gain confidence not only in my role but my influence.

    <h4>Call Centre</h4>
    <p>
      After moving to Auckland, I started in a call centre in downtown Auckland
      for Tower Insurance. This was the change I needed to challenge myself
      while building on the skillset I had. I started in customer service and
      worked my way up to being a part of the sales team. I have always liked to
      continuously learn and grow, so after a few years, I decided to explore
      other parts of the business. I worked with the Business insurance team,
      retention, and TradeMe team until I found claims. Moving to claims was a
      hugely rewarding change, where I was dealing with motor claims for boats,
      bikes and personal use vehicles. I would assist customers as well as
      businesses, manage financial responsibilities and be able to context
      switch between several claims at one time. At the end of 6 months, It was
      harder to leave work at work as dealing with severe incidents that our
      customers were involved with began to take a toll. I left to join the
      Department of Internal Affairs with the passport team. I would often deal
      with passport applications for customers, help the team reach out to
      customers who needed information and handle calls for other teams as well.
      It was during this time that I fell pregnant and left the corporate
      offices behind me to become a full-time mum.

    <h4>McDonald's</h4>
    <p>
      I started working at McDonald’s as an after school job to pay for things I
      wanted to do with my friends but as I came to the end of school, I wanted
      to stay in Taranaki so decided to stay and worked my way to become the
      youngest manager in the store. At 17 and 18 I was managing a staff team of
      13 most nights, handling customer complaints, sales targets, stock
      management and the running of the store. Before each shift, I would make a
      roster of where our crew members would be set up, list our sale target
      that we needed to meet for each hour, ensure we had enough stock for the
      shift and plan how our team would work together. During the night, it was
      important to engage with the team to see how things were running and that
      we had not only satisfied customers but staff who were able to take breaks
      in order to perform well. This experience taught me about my own
      capabilities as I started to gain more confidence in my role and undertake
      new responsibilities. I decided that I couldn’t grow any more in my
      position and after 7 years of dedication, I decided there was more outside
      our town and moved to Auckland.
