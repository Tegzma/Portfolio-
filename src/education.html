    <p>
      Prior to the Web Development Level 5 programme, my only academic
      experience is from High School and then accomplishments Ive made for
      management through different work experiences. During the Web Development
      Programme, I broadened my knowledge from simple HTML to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Mongo DB</li>
      <li>Postgres</li>
      <li> Working with Insomnia</li>
      <li>Jest</li>
      <li>AWS</li>
    </ul>
      Using a flipped classroom method, we would engage in self-directed learning to go over new
      material and come together in classes to deepen our understanding. Using
      exercises to practice new concepts and larger projects to showcase our
      knowledge of the topic we added to existing code as well as built
      applications from scratch. 
    </p>
      <p>At the end of the 32-week programme, I am able
      to confidently understand and utilise code to create and edit projects. I have made a Portfolio
      website to showcase some of the skills I have learnt in my time. 
      I worked with wire framing designs and C4 architecture to bring visulation to ideas that would solve issues.
      Using these designs I would either work independently or in a group collaborating to make the ideas come to life.
      This was hugely rewarding to work with other people and different coding styles as I believe a persons code is like handwriting: even 
      though its readable, some write differently than others.
      We also learnt about Agile practices and how to work and collaborate, which I have been able utilise in my role and feel 
      is something that can apply to so many roles in the tech sector.

During the summer break of the programme, I undertook a course for AWS which i received a completion badge for.
It was about how to use AWS to deploy projects, how it works to do this, how to monitor and edit your project
as well as how to monitor. This was really useful as we used AWS in our final term to deploy an app.

          Tech is a vast industry which provide various languages and techniques to explore and perfect. 
          I want to continue my learning  and have started learning C++ and .Net.
