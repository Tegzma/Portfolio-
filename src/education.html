      Prior to the Web Development Level 5 programme, my only academic
      experience is from High School and then accomplishments Ive made for
      management through different work experiences. During the Web Development
      Programme, I broadened my knowledge from simple HTML to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Mongo DB</li>
      <li>Postgres</li>
      <li> Working with Insomnia</li>
      <li>Jest</li>
      <li>AWS</li>
    </ul>
      Using a flipped
      classroom method, we would engage in self-directed learning to go over new
      material and come together in classes to deepen our understanding. Using
      exercises to practice new concepts and larger projects to showcase our
      knowledge of the topic we added to existing code as well as built
      applications from scratch. At the end of the 32-week programme, I am able
      to confidently understand and utilise code to create and edit projects.
      This is important to my current role as I have to switch between different
      code projects of learners and dissect them to present to third parties
      including NZQA. I finished with an A or A+ in all areas at the top of my
      cohort. As the repoâ€™s I worked on are part of the learning, I am unable to
      share them as well as the projects worked on during my role as they are
      all privately owned by Developers Institute. I have made a Portfolio
      website to showcase some of the skills I have learnt in my time. I also
      gained a qualification badge with AWS during their summer programme.
