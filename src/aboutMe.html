    <h3>All About Me</h3>
    <h4>My Background</h4>
    <p>
      I am Auckland born, but consider Taranaki to be my home. I spent some of
      the best years of my youth there, where I was able to make lifelong
      friends and meet my partner with who I share my beautiful family. We moved
      to Whangarei just before COVID hit our shores which turned our short
      family visit into a relocation to the winterless North. However, this
      turned out to be the decision we could have made, and are now happily
      thriving. This move along with the circumstances of COVID restrictions
      lead to finding Developers Institute based here in Whangarei, where I
      finally found the courage to pursue a ‘hobby’ full time to make it into my
      career. After I finished my studies in May of 2021, I was offered a
      full-time position as part of the Developers Institute team. I was able to
      use my newly acquired skills and match them with my previous skills in
      customer experience to help shape and support new learners in my role as
      Quality Assurance and Learner Wellbeing Associate Developer.

    <h4>My Family Life</h4>
    <p>
      I was lucky enough to find someone with who I could share life from
      Taranaki and for the last 11 years, we have managed to explore different
      parts of the country, take on new and exciting adventures before starting
      a family of our own. We had moved to Auckland in 2015 to build our careers
      and open ourselves to big city living after coming from a small town that
      doesn’t even have traffic lights. Safe to say our lives became more
      fast-paced and always busy. In 2018 we welcomed our Daughter Brooklyn into
      the world. She changed our perspectives on how we wanted to live and raise
      our daughter which sparked the move back to Taranaki to be closer to
      family and a slower-paced lifestyle. In 2019 we lost our youngest daughter
      who was born prematurely. This again sparked change in us where we wanted
      to share things that our small town couldn’t give her and make the most of
      our time as a family together. We decided to move to Australia, where many
      of our family lived and had opportunities for our whole family. We made
      the trip to Whangarei where we would spend our last month with family
      after selling all our belongings. While we were there, the first lockdown
      hit and we had nowhere else to go. After spending months in lockdown, we
      got to explore and fell in love with everything Northland had to offer -
      beaches, bush walks, safe places for Brooklyn to play, close to some of
      our family and then the opportunity of pursuing my dream of getting into
      the tech industry. From there, the rest is history and now our family has
      grown with the addition of a furry family member - Coco.

    <h4>My Interests</h4>
    <p>
      I love everything to do with food. Making meals, sharing them with the
      people I love, experiencing new foods, baking, bbq - I am a self-appointed
      foodie. In my free time, baking goodies with my daughter to share with our
      family or friends or simply making a nice meal at the end of the day is
      where my family and I find our base - a simple task that reminds us to be
      present. In my youth I loved sports from competitive Lawn bowls to Rugby;
      I found passion in being active with the enjoyment of friendly
      competition. As our family grows that passion has shifted to outdoor
      adventures. Beaches, bushwalks, waterfalls, outdoor picnics, long walks,
      hikes to lighthouses and finding a quiet spot to let Coco and Brooklyn run
      free to explore. Work-life balance is very important to me. I always put
      in as much effort into my work as I would my family life as they both add
      so much to me as a person. My work grows my ambitions, drive, opens me to
      opportunities, continuous learning and collaboration. Whereas my family
      fills my life with happiness, love, comfort and joy.
