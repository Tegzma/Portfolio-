# Portfolio

Welcome to a snippet to a current snapshot of my life, interests, goals and motivations as of February 2022.
This project is to highlight the skills I have learnt, while also being able to connect with colleagues and peers.


## Getting Started
1. `clone` the project repository to your local computer using VS Code or the Terminal.
2. The code for this project is located in the website folder.
3. You can view the site at https://techtegz.netlify.app/index.html 

As changes are made and pushed to the main branch of the repository, the changes will be automaticaly intergrated and added to the live site using https://www.netlify.com/
Additonal branches made will need to be merged using a pull request before they are added to the main and the changes are reflected on the live site.

###Static Folder 

This folder houses the style sheet for CSS design that has been added and where changes can be made.
Images are also held in this folder under 'img'.
